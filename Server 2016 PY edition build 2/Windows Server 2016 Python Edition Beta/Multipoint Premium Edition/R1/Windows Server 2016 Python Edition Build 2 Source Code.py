#i have to get this done, i will work on this project
#over the summer of 2018
#this program is modeled to look like windows server 2016, and act
#as the most possibly stripped down, but decent version
#of windows server 2016
#so far, it is looking GREAT!
#although, it will take a while to add all the planned features...
#this is the first build of this program, and it is based off the 17th build of the windows server 2016 python edition program

#DEVELOPER QUESTIONS ANSWERED HERE
#*********************************************
#Question: Why did you claim to make this "a better windows parody"?
#*********************************************
#Answer: I have seen A LOT of windows Parodies made by kids from 2002-2009 on YouTube 
#Some of them reuploaded from newgrounds and other flash sites
#and there are a lot of misconceptions. They were funny at the time (to some people) but these
#days, they are so common, that they became stale. I plan on revolutionizing the idea
#*********************************************
#Question: Is this program at all helpful?
#*********************************************
#Answer: Somewhat. People are allowed to reprogram the project, which teaches programming
#and there are also some fake files located in the file explorer (9 files) that teach 
#people about fake and non-existant file formats (as of this date: 6.13.2018)
#Other than that, it is all fun and games!
#*********************************************
#Question: How long did this take to make?
#*********************************************
#Answer: This is a spinoff to a school project for my 10th grade programming class that i decided to
#take further development on. It was originally made on py3.codeskulptor.org as an
#assignment for animation. I think it counts as animation, since it is also interactive
#pther than movements.
#*********************************************
#Question: Is this project appropriate for kids?
#*********************************************
#Answer: Somewhat, i recommend parental guidance. Some of the jokes are [PG] (if you overthink them)
#But most likely, your kids won't get the jokes, unless they got it from somewhere else. rating: [PG]
#[E10+]
#*********************************************
#Question: Did you enjoy making this?
#*********************************************
#Answer: Yes, it was really fun, and it had a good outcome. I liked writing the jokes, and the scripts
#for this program
#*********************************************

#severe development error
#this will be really hard for me to make since:
#1: i need to find several images for this project, and put them in
#2: i have to make it functional
#3: it might require some workers to develop
#4: this may take the whole summer, as it is really advanced
#5: i cannot easily find workers for this project
