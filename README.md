## Significance

This was an extension of my end of year Python assignment for chapter 5 of my first year of Python classes. It is also my second Python program to utilize 3D graphics, however I did poorly on this. When I originally made this, I only got it to work on [Codeskulptor 3](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/) but no-where else.
This project posed a challenge for me at the time, and I need to do more really challenging work again to train myself better.

Build 3 - Coming soon, will be named `Windows Server 2016 Python Edition Build 3 Source Code`

## Add-ons

Add-ons are directories that are extras for the project that can be copied to the root of the build to get new features. Currently, there are 4 add-ons for this project:

All the add-ons that work on Windows 10 Python Edition will work with this project, as their codebase is almost exact

## Passwords for builds

There is 1 build of Windows 10 Python Edition that requires a password to unzip, as I made it like that to test zip file passwords. However, no versions of Windows Server 2016 Python Edition require a password to extract.

## Codeskulptor

I have not gotten this program to work in regular Python yet, but I have gotten it to work on the python 3 Codeskulptor website. You can test it [here](https://py3.codeskulptor.org).

## Known issues

There are some known issues with this project. They include:

1. Some files have an unnecessary `(1)` in their name. A duplication error happened a long time ago, and I chose to keep it in so that I could make a complete archive

2. Most of the scripts do not work, some only work with codeskulptor [see above](#Codeskulptor).

3. No other known issues at the moment.

## Other notes

1. Back when I made this, I didn't know that Iot was spelled with an i, I thought it was spelled with an L and I didn't know what it meant.

2. There are several files and directories with (1) in the name. This was an error that made its way into many versions, out of a duplication error

3. Most Python files aren't functional.

4. Once I learned how to upload directories to GitHub, the next day, I applied this skill to this project, and it helped boost development significantly.

5. No other notes at the moment
